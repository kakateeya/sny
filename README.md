Surya Namaskar Yagnya Android app, Google App Engine Server

Before it can work with the appengine back end, you need to add the credentials/information to the following files
- snygae/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml (The app engine app ID)
- web client ID to app/src/main/java/org/hss/sny/sooryanamaskarayagnya/Config.java
- APP_ENGINE_SERVER_URL in app/src/main/java/org/hss/sny/sooryanamaskarayagnya/ServerApi.java

I used the Android Studio with Google Plugin for development. I recommend the same for easiness.
